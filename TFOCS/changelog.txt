        examples/demos/         Directory with demos (featured on website) is
            added
        test_TraceLS.m          Added. Shows how to run solver_TraceLS.m
        test_psdCompletion.m    Added. Shows how to run solver_psdComp.m and
            solver_psdCompConstrainedTrace.m
        Contents.m              Added. Describes the relevant functions.

    Modified private/tfocs_prox.m, prox_l1.m, and tfocs_SCD.m to allow
        mu to be a vector. Need to modify other prox functions.
    Modified test_proxPair.m to test with symmetric, psd, and sparse matrices.
    Modified prox_spectral.m to take advantage of symmetric matrices
    Modified linop_subsample.m to work in more situations
    Modified proj_psd.m to use eigs() if requested, though this is usually not
        beneficial

    Fixed bug in prox_hinge.m (for y = [] case ). 
    Fixed bug in private/tfocs_iterate.m for stopCrit = Inf case
        Thanks to Masoud Ahookhosh for finding this. 
    Fixed bugs in solver_psdComp.m and solver_psdCompConstrainedTrace.m
    Made proj_l1.m more numerically stable; thanks to Chris Kauffman for finding
        and fixing this.
    Made size_compat.m allow multiple singleton dimensions in ND arrays; thanks
        to Graham Coleman for finding and fixing this.

Feb 29 2012, v1.1a
    Minor bug fixes, thanks to Graham Coleman for finding them:
    
    private/print_cell_size.m incorrectly displayed the size of inputs (only
        applied in "debug" mode)
    private/size_compat.m has been fixed to work with 3D (or ND) arrays
        when the final array dimension is a singleton (e.g. 20 x 30 x 1)

Jan 25 2012, v1.1 
    User guide updated.
    Changes to code:
    New:
        linop_fft.m         FFT and its transpose. Supports sub-sampling.
        test_proxPair.m     Tests whether f and fDual are really duals. Not yet

            also new, and allows you to watch a movie in real-time of
            the iterates. Also shows how to use reweighting.

        test_all.m          runs all small scale examples
        linop_reshape.m     reshapes input (an extension of linop_vec). Thanks
            to Graham Coleman for contributing.
        tfocs.m             "debug" option added to main tfocs routine

    Bug fixes:
        solver_sSDP.m       fixed bug, thanks to Brian Borchers.  
        prox_hingeDual.m    fixed NaN bug
        continuation.m      fixed bug for case when there are multiple matrix
            variables, and for 3D arrays (thanks to Graham Coleman).
        prox_spectral.m     fixed bugs

            matrices rather than vectors; thanks to Graham Coleman for discovering.
        all solvers:        fixed a bug with variable "L" that arose whenever
            there is a function called "L.m" in the path (for example, WaveLab has
            such a function).
        tfocs_LLM.m         fixed bug that occurs when restart is used
        tfos_initialize.m   fixed bug for strong convexity case when Lexact not

        proj_0.m            fixed bug for non-constant offsetsl thanks to Graham
            Colemen

    Improvements:
        tfocs.m             allows new "debug" flag that gives more verbose
            information, useful when debugging
        tfocs_inizialize.m  gives more useful error message when sizes are
            incorrect
        tfocs_iterate.m     Improved performance for stopCrit = 3
        tfocs_iterate.m     Now supports 'printStopCrit' to display progress of
            whatever value is used to determine the stopping criteria
        linop_test.m        Supports conjugate-symmetric complex inputs/outputs
        test_sBPDN_withContinuation.m         Updated 
        solver_sBP.m        Supports non-negativity constraints
        solver_sBPDN.m      Supports non-negativity constraints
        tfocs_AT.m          Now includes cntr_reset field, which explicitly
            recalculates some quantities every so often to avoid accumulation
            of roundoff error.
        proj_boxDual.m --> prox_boxDual.m   to have more consistent naming.
        proj_l2.m           handles diagonal scaling term; this feature is
            experimental and uses a 1D optimization routine. It should
            be efficient for N <= 2^18 at least
        prox_l2.m           same experimental modification as in proj_l2.m
        linop_scale.m       allows user to specify size explicitly, if desired
        prox_hinge.m and prox_hingeDual.m   allow more general form with "y"
            variable
        example_{LMI, LinearProgram, SDP} renamed to test_{LMI, LinearProgram,
            SDP }
